First, I used INSERT to add parameter values to columns.

Then, I ran SELECT * FROM users to test if my data was inserted correctly.

Next, I ran a series of updates to my users table to update the existing data. I performed simple behaviors like concatenation and addition to manipulate my data. I deleted an existing record. And I got specific with my queries by using the WHERE
  and ORDER BY commands. This allowed me to do things like order the output in ascending form, starting from the 3rd row of data.

The most challenging part of this assignment was creating these from memory. They are not fully engrained yet. Must practice more.
